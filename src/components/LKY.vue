    <p class="description">Many Singaporeans are faced with the struggle of unemployment, especially during these tumultous times. As an intern of the LKY Research Center, I am responsible for researching and analysing the impacts of the pandemic on different age groups of Singaporeans and how they play a role in Singapore's workforce and economy today. Additionally, I am working with a team to create a platform to help those facing such difficult times in hopes to alleviate the stress of providing for themselves and their families during this time.</p>
